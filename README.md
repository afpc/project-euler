# Project Euler in Haskell

**DISCLAIMER**

Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from 
experiencing that epiphany of discovery. Please do **NOT** just look at the
solutions straight away.

Only the first one-hundred problems can be shared publicly. These also have 
a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material on the 
[website](https://projecteuler.net/) itself.
